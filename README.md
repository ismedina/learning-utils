# learning-utils: Python scripts to enhance your learning

`learning-utils` is a small respository where I will upload the small scripts that I use to enhance my study, specially when it comes to learning languages. Most if not all the scripts are written in Python to make them as quick to write and accesible as possible.

Currently the repository contains:

* `learning_utils.py`: here I will gather all the main functions of the project.
* `excel_to_csv.py`: a small script that exports all `.xls` files in the current directory to `.csv`, making them importable from flashcards programs such as Anki (which I totally recommend because it is open source, free and multi-platform). You can see how it acts over the given example `chapter1.csv`.
* `random_grammar.py`: samples a collection of the bullet points contained in `grammar.md` and displays it. Useful for improving your writing skills and not forget the resources you have learnt.
